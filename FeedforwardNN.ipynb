    "# FeedForward Tutorial\n",
    "---\n",
    "A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do not form a cycle. As such, it is different from recurrent neural networks. It is illustrated in the following figure\n",
    "![title](img/feed_forward.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and activation funtion to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/single.png)\n",
    "The simplest kind of neural network is a single-layer perceptron network, which consists of a single layer of output nodes; the inputs are fed directly to the outputs via a series of weights. In this way it can be considered the simplest kind of feed-forward network. The sum of the products of the weights and the inputs is calculated in each node, and if the value is above some threshold (typically 0) the neuron fires and takes the activated value (typically 1); otherwise it takes the deactivated value (typically -1). \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Activation Function ?\n",
    "You could have a question about activation function. It’s just a thing (node) that you add to the output end of any neural network. It is also known as **Transfer Function**. It can also be attached in between two Neural Networks.It is used to determine the output of neural network like yes or no. It maps the resulting values in between 0 to 1 (sigmoid) whatever the inputs are.\n",
    "![title](img/sigmoid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-layer perceptron network : \n",
    "It can only solve linear problems such as AND problem and OR problem (see the following figure)\n",
    "![title](img/linear.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it cannot solve XOR problem due to it is a non-linear problem. We could not use a single line to split it to two parts.(see the following figure)\n",
    "![title](img/nonlinear.png)\n",
    "If we use two and more layers of neural network, it colud solve the problem with two decision boundaries like the following figure.**Each \"Decision Boundary\" line represents one layer** in our MLP.\n",
